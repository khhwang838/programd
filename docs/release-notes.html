        <p>
            This is a highly-recommended release which preserves AIML functionality, introduces some interesting
            perforamnce improvements, fixes a number of important bugs,
            and brings some major architectural improvements&mdash;most notably, Program D can now be deployed as a .war file
            to a web application server, and can interact with a web client using &quot;Ajax&quot; technologies.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Several strategic optimizations have dramatically increased the number of bots that
                    Program D can handle, improved response rates, and reduced memory usage. 
                    Most notably, if you have bots that share AIML files, Program D
                    will now detect this, and will
                    use a shortcut at loadtime to rapidly add an association
                    with the AIML file for the new bot, without actually re-parsing the entire AIML file.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    At long last, Program D is now a &quot;proper&quot; web application, in J2EE terms. The bundled web
                    server, and associated dependencies, have been removed, and you may now deploy Program D as a .war
                    file on any J2EE web application server. Testing has been primarily with Tomcat, but theoretically
                    this should work with any open source or commerical Java web application server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web pages for Program D are now JSP pages. Program D includes a couple of AIML-JSP tags that
                    can be included in such pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The &quot;simple console&quot; and &quot;simple GUI console&quot; modes are still available, and of
                    course if you only need Program D for IM/IRC connectivity, then one of these (probably the non-GUI
                    version) will be your choice. (But please see the <a href="http://aitools.org">aitools.org</a> web
                    site and <a href="http://aitools.org/mailinglists.html">Program D mailing list</a> for the latest
                    word on IM &amp; IRC compatibility issues with those listeners&mdash;lately there have been some
                    problems.)

                <p>
                    Program D can now be easily used with &quot;Ajax&quot; technologies. Included in the download is a
                    simple working example, making use of the <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/">DWR</a> Ajax
                    toolkit. This example can be viewed by deploying the Program D .war file to a J2EE application
                    server.

                    The interactive shell has a couple of new commands: <b>/memory</b>, which provides statistics
                    on memory usage, and <b>/categories</b>, which shows the number of loaded categories.

                <p>
                    The logging mechanism for Program D has been vastly improved by replacing the off-the-shelf JDK
                    logging mechanism with the vastly superior <a
                    href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">Log4J</a> library. Logging to text files, XML files,
                    and databases is still supported, and is now configured in the <b>log4j.xml</b> file.

                <p>
                    The following bugs have been fixed in version 4.6:

                            This was resolved in a release candidate for 4.5, but some reports indicated it may have
                            resurfaced in the final release. In any case, this is fixed in 4.6, and what&#39;s more,
                            the entire logging infrastructure has been redone (see <a
                            href="#v4.6.whatsnew.logging">above</a>), so database logging should also show better
                            performance and more flexibility.

                            This issue is resolved by the use of JSP and the web server architecture. Botmasters now
                            have full control over which templates are used for which requests, using the application
                            server&#39;s mechanisms for mapping URLs.

                        <p>
                            This issue was caused by a problem in the substitution mechanism, and actually affected all
                            substitution operations (although not all operations produced incorrect results with this
                            bug). It has been corrected, and a new test case has been added to the AIML test suite to
                            verify it.

                        <p>
                            This issue has been obviated by the switch to the web application architecture. There is
                            now an error page (customizable, of course) that can be displayed when an error occurs in
                            Program D.

                            class="literal">&lt;html:pre&gt;</span> correctly</a>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            This issue arose because whitespace was being &quot;normalized&quot; in several places in
                            the Program D code, with the intention of obeying the <a
                            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec/#section-white-space-handling">specification</a>. A
                            solution has been implemented which does not technically match the specification, but which
                            does not seem to preclude producing the desired results in any case. Basically, for now,
                            whitespace is generally <em>not</em> normalized, but is preserved as specified in the
                            original AIML document. The determination of how to handle whitespace is left to the
                            client, rather than determined by the AIML interpreter. A web browser will, as usual,
                            normalize whitespace within all elements except a <span class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</span>
                            element-precisely the desired behavior. This strategy actually makes more sense, since
                            without this, the AIML interpreter would need to either (a) require that all
                            whitespace-preserving elements have the <span class="literal">xml:space</span> attribute
                            set to <span class="literal">&quot;preserve&quot;</span> (an undesirable requirement for
                            the user to duplicate information that already exists in the DTD/schema for the foreign

                            for <span class="literal">xml:space</span> attributes in that specification and process
                            accordingly (a significant performance issue). My research indicates that the proper
                            handling of this issue in <em>any</em> XML application is not a settled matter, and thus
                            for the moment I am content to provide a solution which will in any reasonable circumstance
                            allow the desired result to be achieved. At some future point, this may be revisited.

                            what</a>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Listeners in general are a lot of trouble, because IM protocols, and even IRC practices,
                            change very often. Specialized libraries exist to allow applications to communicate using
                            these protocols, and the listeners for Program D depend on these libraries. Unfortunately,
                            these libraries are not always well maintained, or are not Java-based, or are not open
                            source/free. <strong>However</strong>, with all that said, the Program D core should
                            <em>not</em> crash simply because a listener cannot connect or has some other error. As
                            also noted in <a href="http://bugs.aitools.org/view.php?id=99">issue 99</a> (next item),
                            the Program D code was previously much too skittish about error conditions, and pretty much
                            gave up the ghost whenever any serious error occurred. That has now been corrected, and as
                            a result, issues with listeners should not impact the core (even if the listeners
                            themselves have unrelated problems).

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            In an attempt to motivate myself to quickly fix problems in the Program D code, I created a
                            subclass of <span class="literal"><a
                            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Error.html">java.lang.Error</a></span>
                            called <span class="literal"><a
                            href="http://aitools.org/programd/docs/api/org/aitools/programd/util/DeveloperError.html">DeveloperError</a></span>.
                            This was to be thrown in cases where some error occurred that I felt could be reasonably
                            blamed on the Program D code, rather than some third party. In the event of a <span
                            class="literal">DeveloperError</span>, Program D was set up to terminate immediately, with
                            a message reflecting negatively on the developer (me) and providing diagnostic information.
                            However, it turns out that this approach was far too aggressive, and was needlessly causing
                            the program to commit suicide in many cases where it could have reasonably recovered and
                            continued execution. Therefore, I have re-thought this whole strategy, and made two
                            changes: (a) <span class="literal">DeveloperError</span> is used far less than before, and
                            (b) in cases where it <em>is</em> used, it is not allowed to kill the application. As much
                            as possible, Program D will attempt to continue execution no matter what happens.

        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the first release of Program D in three years. During this time, Program D has remained the most
            widely used open source / free AIML interpreter in the world. It has been employed in numerous projects,
            from personal-sized art projects to large, enterprise level deployments. The stability and consistent
            performance achieved in version 4.1.5 have proven enduring and reliable, despite the hiatus in available
            support.
        </p>
        <p>
            This new release focuses on updating the Program D technology to take advantage of progress in technologies
            available as part of the core Java platform. Core functionalities such as XML parsing, logging, and various
            architectural matters are now handled in a fashion that heightens stability, performance and
            maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have finally addressed the issue of component orientation: Program D can now be easily included into any
            application framework as a simple &quot;core&quot; object, without ever involving any undesired interfaces
            (servlet container, IM interface, etc.). On the other hand, these optional interfaces now use a more
            flexible and better defined API to connect to the Core, and we are confident that additional interfaces may
            now be provided with far more ease than before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every line of code of Program D has been reviewed, and &quot;refactored&quot; as appropriate. The program
            still passes all of the AIML 1.0.1 test cases published with the previous version, as well as a few more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following are details of what has been addressed. Please note that, as of the final release, items
            originally found only under the <a href="#v4.5.rc-notes">Release Candidate Notes</a> section have been

                    The architecture of Program D has been thoroughly re-worked to make a clean separation between the
                    &quot;core&quot; parts of the program-those which load AIML, parse inputs, and produce a
                    response-and other parts, such as IM interfaces, web server interfaces, and so on. It is possible
                    to instantiate the Program D Core object and configure it entirely programmatically, without
                    manipulating any configuration files, if that is required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the simplest form, using Program D from another program looks like:
                </p>
<pre class="code">
Core core = new Core();
core.setup();
core.start();
String response = core.processResponse(&quot;hello&quot;);
</pre>
                <p>
                    The Core can be (and usually is) initialized with a properties file. The additional <span
                    class="literal">setup()</span> step is separated out so that, for instance, consoles can be
                    connected to the Core before proceeding with initialization. Following <span
                    class="literal">setup()</span>, there is again the opportunity to do any further setup of other
                    components before calling <span class="literal">start()</span> on the Core. The <span
                    class="literal">getResponse()</span> method comes in several forms, including those that allow the
                    specification of a particular bot, and the use of a <span class="literal">Responder</span> object
                    to format input and output.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The old <span class="literal">.properties</span> file has been replaced with several XML-formatted
                    equivalents. Configuration is broken up among optional components-all configuration of the Core
                    happens in <span class="literal">conf/core.xml</span>, of the console in <span
                    class="literal">conf/console.xml</span>, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of these configuration files corresponds to a class which is automatically generated using a
                    simple (included) XSLT file. (The classes only need to be regenerated when the semantics of the
                    properties are changed.) The generated class includes getter and setter methods for every property,
                    so a Core object can be configured completely programmatically as well:
                </p>
<pre class="code">
core.setRootDirectory(&quot;/usr/local/ProgramD/4.5-test&quot;);

                </h4>
                <p>
                    The &quot;homegrown&quot; XML parser included in previous releases has been replaced with a
                    combination of SAX2 and DOM parsers now included as standard with the Java SDK. The results are
                    very satisfactory. Not only is the new parsing performance at least as good as the old homemade
                    stuff, but we now have built-in well-formedness checking <em>and</em> schema validation (see next
                    note). The standard XML parsing technology is used in all aspects of the program where it applies:
                    reading in AIML, parsing AIML templates at runtime, parsing bot configuration files, and parsing
                    HTML templates (if used).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the XML parsers in use have been configured to be namespace aware, which moves us
                    farther in the direction of being a highly interoperable platform. For instance, any embedded HTML
                    or XHTML must now be properly notated as to its namespace; this enables Responders and other tools
                    to easily filter out (or not) markup belonging to one or another namespace, and to do it in an
                    intelligent, configurable way, rather than relying on ad hoc heuristics that keep specific
                    &quot;knowledge&quot; of HTML or some other format embedded in the engine.

                    AIML files are read in by the program, they are validated against this schema. Any errors are
                    reported to the console and log files. As long as an error is not fatal, the remainder of the AIML

                    Long overdue, this has at last been addressed comprehensively in 4.5. Now, if your AIML contains

                    specify what should happen at loadtime. As your AIML is loaded, the program will decide what to do
                    with the template in an already-loaded category whose path is matched by another category being
                    loaded. These are the merge policy choices:

                    (expensive) casting. Typesafe enums have also been employed to great effect in quite a few places.
                    The enhanced <span class="literal">for</span> loop, which in almost all cases obviates the need for
                    using an Iterator, has been employed everywhere possible. And in a couple of instances we make use
                    of autoboxing/unboxing of primitive types.

                    Incorporating all of these improvements has made the code easier to read, and therefore to debug
                    and maintain. In quite a few cases, performance gains also seem to have been realized.

                    makes a lot of to take full advantage of the extensive compile-time checking that the platform can
                    provide, in the interest of avoiding runtime errors. Why be half-hearted about it?

                    way to trap it, and if at all possible, log it. This kind of progress is always good, although I do
                    think that Program D was already pretty well along with the last release.

                    Numerous bugs that were never widely known or reported have been fixed. Going forward, all new bugs
                    should be visible in the <a href="http://bugs.aitools.org">bug tracking system</a>, but there are
                    no plans at the moment to retroactively publicly document all the problems that have already been
                    found and corrected. Suffice it to say that the current codebase is significantly less error-prone,
                    and more secure, than previous releases.

                            <strong>Merge policies implemented</strong>-Long overdue, this has been addressed in time
                            for the final release. Now, if your AIML contains categories whose <span
                            class="literal">pattern:that:topic</span> paths are identical, you can specify what should
                            happen at loadtime. As your AIML is loaded, the program will decide what to do with the
                            template in an already-loaded category whose path is matched by another category being
                            loaded. These are the merge policy choices:

                                    <strong>skip:</strong> Leave the currently loaded template in place and ignore the
                                    new one.

                            was completely rewritten using a new library, and a Yahoo listener was introduced.

                            This was reported in several bugs. It has been corrected.

                            full working-over, and now for the first time this is offered as part of the standard

                            distribution. You can test Program D&#39;s adherence to the spec simply by typing <span
                            class="literal">/test</span> in the shell.

                            be available from the shell by implementing a simple interface. To be documented.

                            contents from the command line. Try, for example, typing: <span class="literal">/aiml

                            name, rather than a special &quot;label&quot; string which is supposed to be matched by a
                            listener class. Internally, the &quot;<span class="literal">ListenerRegistry</span>&quot;
                            has been eliminated. This makes the listener architecture properly pluggable-you can
                            literally write your own listener, add it to the classpath, and put configuration
                            parameters in the configuration file, all without doing anything to the core of Program D.

            Program D requires <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">JDK 5</a>. See <a
            href="#v4.5.whatsnew.java-language">above</a> for the reasons why. The benefits available from this new
            release far outweigh the problem that JDK 5 is not yet available for all platforms. If you are a user of a
            platform that does not yet have JDK 5 support, you are strongly encouraged to get involved in hastening the
            day when it does.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to build Program D from the source distribution, you can easily import it into a Java IDE such
            as <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Or you can use the included Ant buildfile, which is the same
            file used to create the binary distributions. Starting with 4.5(rc3), you will need to have your own copy
            of <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> installed.

                    The AIML schema includes embedded <a href="http://xml.ascc.net/resource/schematron/schematron.html"
                    target="_blank">Schematron</a> directives that fill in a validation gap that <a
                    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Jun/0026.html">W3C XML Schemas cannot
                    address</a>-namely, the three forms of <span class="literal">condition</span>. A similar approach
                    could probably take care of the other remaining gap of which I&#39;m aware: the text part of mixed
                    pattern expressions, which is currently not fully constrained by the schema. However, as of this
                    writing, I haven&#39;t found how to process the Schematron directives as part of the loadtime
                    validation process, so you still have the possibility of loading some limited forms of &quot;bad
                    AIML&quot;. You may, of course, validate your AIML using any good modern XML tool, and it will be
                    able to use the embedded Schematron directives. Coincidentally, the reprocessed AAA AIML set
                    available on aitools.org does pass this additional test when validated manually.

                    over-redacted, since quite a lot needed to be updated to reflect changes in property names, etc.
                    Any help in this is greatly appreciated, or it will get back to its full glory sooner or later in
                    any case.

                    it yet. The new test case framework (as of rc3) does a great job of testing key AIML interpreter
                    functionality, but of course it would be very desirable to have a complete testing framework that
                    would cover all aspects of the application. Again, it&#39;s in the pipeline....

            This release of Program D is significant for stability and important functionality improvements. Here is a
            list of highlights:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Multiple Bot Support
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Program D now supports an unlimited number of bots running from the same process. You configure the
                    bots in the <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file. Different bots may share one or more
                    AIML files, and memory usage is optimized to minimize duplication. Bots can be enabled or disabled
                    easily by toggling an attribute in the <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file.
                </p>
                <p class="additional-notes">
                    The example <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file has been moved to the <span
                    class="literal">conf</span> directory, and is documented inline with XML comments.
                </p>

            <li>

                    class="literal">&lt;person&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;person2&gt;</span>) as well as the
                    <span class="literal">&lt;predicates&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;properties&gt;</span>,
                    and <span class="literal">&lt;sentence-splitters&gt;</span> elements of the <span
                    class="literal">startup.xml</span> file can each be assigned an <span class="literal">href</span>
                    attribute pointing to a local file that contains the actual definitions. This allows multiple bots
                    to share such definitions, or portions thereof, without needless duplication.
                </p>
                <p class="additional-notes">
                    The example <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file illustrates this configuration.

                <h4>
                    Better Configuration of Listeners
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Alice Chat Listeners are now configured in the <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file, and
                    each bot can be assigned its own listener.

                <p class="additional-notes">
                    Because of recent changes to the ICQ protocol, the <span class="literal">AliceICQ</span> listener
                    still does not function correctly (it connects and receives messages, but sent messages are never
                    received). However, it is included in hope that a resourceful individual will be able to get it up
                    to speed and contribute back to the community.

                    Database-based Logging Option
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You can now choose to have all chats logged to a database. This facilitates a form of log viewing
                    that is much more efficient and easier to work with than the XML approach in previous releases. A
                    companion bundle of PHP files for viewing the log database will be released separately.
                </p>
                <p class="additional-notes">
                    You can enable database-based logging by setting <span

                    class="literal">server.properties</span>. You must first create the chatlog table as per the <span
                    class="literal">database/logtables.script</span> file. You also must configure your database
                    settings properly in <span class="literal">server.properties</span>.

                    AIML Syntax Checking
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Program D now does a better job checking some aspects of your AIML syntax when files are loaded.
                    You will be alerted to malformed categories, invalid pattern expressions, and non-AIML elements in
                    certain locations.

                    Simple GUI Console
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A very primitive GUI-based console is available for bot interaction. (This was actually available
                    in a previous release but not documented.) The console window will be a valuable tool for people
                    building bots in non-English languages, because it can (or should) display all characters, not only
                    ASCII/ISO-8859-1, correctly. The GUI provides menu commands for a couple of common shell commands,
                    but otherwise no additional functionality.
                </p>
                <p class="additional-notes">
                    The console can be invoked with <span class="literal">console.bat</span> (Windows) or <span
                    class="literal">console.sh</span> (*nix).

                </h4>
                <p>
                    The bot now has a &quot;heart&quot;, of sorts, that can issue regular pulses to let you know
                    it&#39;s alive. At present the only implemented pulse is a text message to the console, but an
                    interface has been provided so that you can easily add modules that update a database, send email,
                    etc.

            </li>

                    Response Timeout Control
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You can set a maximum time allowed for trying to get a response. For some types of infinite loops,
                    an arbitrary timeout is the only way to escape. This also provides a parameter for tuning
                    scaleability of the server.
                </p>
                <p class="additional-notes">
                    Set the response timeout by editing/adding the <span
                    class="literal">programd.response-timeout</span> property in <span
                    class="literal">server.properties</span>.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    An optimization to the Graphmaster algorithm <a
                    href="http://list.alicebot.org/pipermail/alicebot-developer/2002-March/000723.html">suggested by
                    Richard Wallace on the alicebot-developer list</a> has been implemented. This optimization is
                    intended to reduce match times for patterns that include multiple consecutive wildcards.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Connect and Inactivity Strings
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Now you can customize the strings used as custom inputs to the bot to signal a new connection or
                    inactivity. Also, the connect string is sent to the console user session on starting up (or
                    switching to a new bot) so that you don&#39;t have to type it.

                <p>
                    The targeting tool is still very much a prototype, just a cleaned-up version of what was released
                    in Program dB, but probably many miles/kilometers away from what it ought to be. However, in this
                    version you can actually type in the target panel, which I&#39;d managed to mess up previously.

                    4.1.5 is the last release that predates the Foundation&#39;s new <a
                    href="http://alicebot.org/bugzilla">bug-tracking system</a>. Subsequent releases will make use of

                            A serious set of <em>thread synchronization</em> problems has been addressed and seems to
                            have eliminated most or all deadlock and race conditions that were causing <em>sporadic,
                            enormous delays</em> in some previous builds.

                            The problems with <em>progressively deteriorating response times</em> seem to have been
                            solved. Even under heavy load, a reasonably-equipped machine should see average response
                            times in the &lt;40ms range, very often down to 1-2ms. We intend to publish some
                            performance test results soon.

                            The <em>pathname handling for learn operations</em> has been improved to work more
                            &quot;intuitively&quot;--i.e., paths that are expressed relative to the files in which they
                            are listed should work.

            Program D 4.1.5 requires a JVM or JRE that is compatible with the <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html" target="_blank">Java 2 Platform version 1.4</a>. If you
            do not intend to modify the source code, you can download just the JRE (Java Runtime Edition), which is
            significantly smaller than the SDK (about 9MB as compared with ~40!).
        </p>
        <p>
            The current reason for the Java upgrade requirement is an internationalization-related issue that may not

                    Many people have expressed the desirability of more cleanly separating Program D from Jetty in
                    order to allow use of better-quality servlet containers (such as Tomcat, WebLogic, JRun, etc.).
                    This isn&#39;t done yet but appears to be a trivial task. However, presently the significant
                    integration of the bot server with a web server other than Jetty is more hypothetical than actual.

                    The question of merge policies still hasn&#39;t been satisfactorily addressed.

                <p>
                    The program can still be flummoxed by malformed AIML. The decision to require Java SDK 1.4 opens
                    the way to using standard XML technologies now included with Java (previous linkages caused
                    problems with the GNU GPL), but research is needed to measure the tradeoffs between improving this
                    aspect and possible performance degradation.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally, the program is now at the stage where it could use a real overhaul in architecture.
                    Several discussions are going on semi-independently about this subject.

        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;secret.key&quot; problem with DBMultiplexor fixed
            </li>
            <li>
                Important fix to sentence-splitting: problem with method was causing multiple consecutive punctuation
                marks to generate multiple &quot;sentences&quot;, so an input like &quot;hi!!!!!!!!!!&quot; would get a
                long, long response.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed error in which values saved to database weren&#39;t being properly escaped.
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;targets directory not found&quot; problem fixed.

            Functional improvements
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented support of default predicate values, and return-name-when-set predicates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Configurable caching system now caches predicates in memory, writes out to disk or database only when
                necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                IRC, ICQ and AIM listeners now work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interactive shell has been extended to permit: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        commanding listeners (currently AliceIRC is enabled this way by means of illustration)

            <li>
                direct checking of some types of infinite loops
            </li>
            <li>
                XML chat log now has a &quot;rollover&quot; capability -- will not write more than a fixed number of
                entries to file before rolling it over.
            </li>
            <li>
                XML chat log viewing stylesheet looks in local directory for entity declaration resources, rather than
                to the W3C

            Code improvements, changes
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Somewhat better management of threads; inclusion of a shutdown hook from main Aliceserver in order to
                do cleanup before dying.
            </li>
            <li>
                Introduction of PredicateMaster -- removal of &quot;StaticSelf&quot; mess from Multiplexor, and
                somewhat more clarity about what a Multiplexor is all about.
            </li>
            <li>
                Moved Trace and MessagePrinter to util; devinfo and devfail methods will now print the name of the
                method that called them (not quite perfect but useful).
            </li>
            <li>
                AIMLReader works just a bit faster now, by recreating the StringBuffer after each new category is
                created.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dependence on third-party &quot;LinkedList&quot; and &quot;LinkedListItr&quot; has been eliminated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now use &quot;XMLResourceSpec&quot; instead of my embarassing String array for calling XMLWriter.
            </li>
            <li>
                introduction of UserErrorException and DeveloperErrorException for the promotion of responsible coding
                ;-)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Other notable changes
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                JavaScript interpreter is no longer hard-linked -- could easily be replaced by a wrapper for another
                one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hypersonic SQL code has been removed entirely.
            </li>
            <li>
                This marks the end of the effort to decouple Program D from GPL-incompatible code. We recognize that a
                tightly-linked combination of ALICE code with GPL-incompatible code is a contradiction of the terms of
                the GPL, and have striven to re-align the codebase with the spirit and terms of the GPL.

            Finally it&#39;s here -- the final reference version of Program D! Big thanks to Tom and Pedro, who have
            taken upon themselves the difficult task of bringing the reference implementation as close to the AIML 1.0
            specification as possible. Their work has finished now -- the server is fully under the GPL, and you can
            safely use version 4.1.2 as a reference base for further development. If it&#39;s good, your work may even

                        Solved sequencing problem at load time that prevented the simultaneous usage of the

        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the &#39;reference&#39; version Thomas Ringate and Pedro E. Colla have been working on. It is
            intermediate work in progress, with the goal to make Program D AIML 1.0 compliant. Currently, in version
            4.1.0 ref, the support for AIML 1.0 is partial and achieved thru quick fixes. For the most part, AIML 0.9
            is yet supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don&#39;t use this release as a base for further development, there will yet be major changes in the code.
            The next release 4.1.1 will hopefully adress the above issues within the next 2 weeks.<br />

            Now comes WITHOUT any AIML, you must install an aiml set manually and configure it in the SERVER.properties
            file (pointers are in the bots/readme.txt file), otherwise you will get a &#39;FileNotFoundException&#39;.
